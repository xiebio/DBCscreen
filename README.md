# DBCscreen
A pipeline to rapidly detect DNA barcode contamination for biodiversity research

## Test script for protistan contamination screening

```PYTHON
python DBCscreen.py -i input_file -o ./results
```
To ensure DBCscreen runs smoothly, you should first complete the following three steps:

    1. Download FCS-GX from https://github.com/ncbi/fcs/.
    2. Download the DBCscreen database from xx. (coming soon, it has been uploaded to sciencedb, and waiting for page release)
    3. Update the path in the config file to point to the downloaded database and gx.

Any suggestions or problem, please contact Jiazheng Xie（xiejz@cqupt.edu.cn) .
